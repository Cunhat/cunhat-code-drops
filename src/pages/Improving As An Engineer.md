This is a type of goals that normally people have, however they are not good examples because they are a little bit arbitrary and you don’t have start and ends. For example, you don’t lear React, because you are always learning React etc

## “I want to learn React”

- I want to be able to build an app w/ React
- I want to get a job using React

## I want to be able to build an app w/ React

What type of app do you want to build?

- Twitter clone

Conclusion: You will be more successful if you pick more deliverable goals
