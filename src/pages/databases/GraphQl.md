## What is GraphQl?

GraphQl is a way for a client to talk to a server in a share language, usually defined throw a schema, to query or mutate that server for data.

GraphQl is not competing with sql. Is just a way to query data from your client and not querying data from your database to your server like sql.

Is good to solve team boundary problems. Once the backend and front end teams agree on a shared schema and the layer of GraphQl is defined we don’t need to care about whats each team is doing, because we are independent.

From that point we are done. As a front end engineer I don’t need to care how is backend implemented once the schema is defined.

GraphQl makes a very good standard to each team communicated with.

Do not use graphQl for anything other than client to server relations and use it when you have communication problems.
