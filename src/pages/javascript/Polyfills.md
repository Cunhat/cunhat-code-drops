Polyfills are a mechanism that allows to run modern “code” on devices that don’t support some type of functions of this code. Polyfills will run additional code that will allow to run what do you want.

Example: Imagine that we have a function that runs a .map() on Internet explorer. A polyfill will, at runtime, create an old for loop in order to run what it’s supposed.

So a polyfill is code that uses old styles or supported styles to make an unsupported usually more modern thing works.
